## Project setup

Make sure Visual Studio is installed first.

Clone the repository onto your machine.

Download [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bl_tMIT3d_DK8HydmD-6zahEXXGmK_XR) and extract the lib folder into the same directory as your solution (*The libs folder should be at the same level as the .sln file*)

Finally, move the two **dll** files from the libs folder into the root folder. (*The root folder should contain the .sln file, the libs folder, SDL2.dll and glew32.dll*)

Ensure Visual Studio's build configuration is set to x86(32-bit) by selecting Build->Configuration Manager...->Active solution platform:->x86.

You should be able to build and run the project now.

### Mac setup

On mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to get the needed library files.  
Run the following commands to get SDL and GLEW setup on your local machine.

> brew install sdl2  
> brew install glew

Once they are installed, the project should be able to compile just by typing **make** from the root directory of the project. You would still need to download the zip file containing the *libs* folder from the Windows step, since it contains the *stb_image* header.
